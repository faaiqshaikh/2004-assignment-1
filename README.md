In the file 2004-AIES.py I've defined four functions to perform key programming activities on a dictionary:

add_key: Adds a key-value pair to a dictionary.
remove_key: Removes a key-value pair from a dictionary.
update_value: Updates the value of a key in a dictionary.
get_value: Retrieves the value associated with a key from a dictionary.
